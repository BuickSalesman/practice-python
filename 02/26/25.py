# for todays coding, I did an assessment as part of a coding interview for an application I pu tin at cisco. I was able to solve the first of 3 leetcode-esque problems in python, passing all 11 test cases. The second two problems were far out of my depth, and I ended up submitting the assesment with 30 minutes left on the clock when I realized there was no way I was going to be able to solve these things with no help. Either way, I wrote code for over 50 minutes today, and thats good enough to put on the commit calendar!
