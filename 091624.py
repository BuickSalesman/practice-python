# 1. Sum of even numbers using lambda
# Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all even numbers using a lambda function. Example: [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 18.


# 2. Filter out strings longer than 5 characters
# Start with an array of strings and use a lambda function to filter out strings longer than 5 characters. Example: ["apple", "banana", "pear"] becomes ["apple", "pear"].


# 3. Sort an array of hashes by price using lambda
# Sort an array of hashes by the price key using a lambda function. Example: [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes sorted by price.


# 4. Square all numbers in an array using lambda
# Start with an array of numbers and square each one using a lambda function. Example: [2, 3, 4] becomes [4, 9, 16].


# 5. Combine strings into a single string separated by spaces using lambda
# Start with an array of strings and combine them into a single string separated by spaces using a lambda function. Example: ["hello", "world"] becomes "hello world".


# 6. Find the longest string using lambda
# Start with an array of strings and use a lambda function to find the longest string. Example: ["cat", "elephant", "dog"] becomes "elephant".


# 7. Multiply all numbers in an array using lambda (without reduce)
# Start with an array of numbers and compute the product of all numbers using a lambda function. Example: [2, 3, 4] becomes 24.

# 8. Find strings that start with a specific letter using lambda
# Start with an array of strings and use a lambda function to find all strings that start with a specific letter (e.g., 'a'). Example: ["apple", "banana", "avocado"] becomes ["apple", "avocado"].


# print(starts_with_a)
# 9. Find the number with the most digits using lambda
# Start with an array of numbers and use a lambda function to find the number with the most digits. Example: [100, 20, 3000, 4] becomes 3000.


# 10. Remove duplicates from an array using lambda
# Start with an array of numbers and use a lambda function to remove duplicates. Example: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4] becomes [1, 2, 3, 4].
